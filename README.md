# ETHShanghai-Chaineye

This is a project for ETHShanghai Hackathon. Team Chaineye

ChainMap - Users can find interesting participating opportunities on each chain such as yield farming, swap&lending, NFT mining, airdrop, token monitoring, DAO governance, etc. We currently support Optimism, Starknet, Arbitrum, and zkSyncEra and will add more L2 chains in the near future. To support building a thriving ecosystem in layer 2, RPC List is built as a courtesy for developers/users.
